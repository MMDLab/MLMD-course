# What is crystal

Crystals can be observed in various aspects of everyday life, including natural and artificial contexts:

Natural Crystals:
- *Snowflakes*: These are beautiful examples of natural ice crystals with a distinct geometric structure.

- *Gemstones*: Many gemstones, such as diamonds and quartz, are crystalline in nature and exhibit well-defined crystal faces and structures.

- *Salt* and *Sugar*: Both salt and sugar crystals are commonly observed in everyday life, especially when examined under a microscope.

- *Artificial Crystals*: Laboratory-grown Crystals: Crystals can be artificially created in laboratory settings for various applications, such as in electronics and optics.

However, the crystal structure in terms of atomic arrangement plays a much larger role in our lives. Crystals are found in a variety of materials, including:

- *All metals*: Most metals in the [***ground state***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram) at normal conditions have a crystalline structure, with their atoms arranged in a regular and repeating pattern.

- *Ionic Compounds*: Substances like table salt (sodium chloride) and many other ionic compounds form crystals due to the arrangement of positive and negative ions in a regular pattern.

- *Covalent Compounds*: Materials such as ***diamonds***, which are made up of carbon atoms, also have a crystalline structure.

- *Other Substances*: Additionally, materials like ice, ***sugar***, and ***some polymers*** exhibit crystalline structures to varying degrees.

A [***crystal***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal) or ***crystalline solid*** is a solid-phase material whose constituents, such as atoms, molecules, or ions, are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a [***crystal lattice***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure) that extends in all directions. Crystals are characterized by their regular arrangement of atoms or ions, which results in a well-defined internal structure and often a specific geometrical shape with flat faces. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography.

Crystals can be classified into different categories, such as *insulators*, *metals*, *semiconductors*, and *molecular solids*. They can also be classified based on their crystal systems, which include *tetragonal*, *orthorhombic*, *monoclinic*, *triclinic*, *hexagonal*, and *trigonal* systems. 

Crystals can have natural origins, forming through inorganic or organic processes, or they can be artificially created in laboratories.

Examples of crystals include *snowflakes*, *diamonds*, *metals* and *alloys* or *ceramic materials*. Some crystals, like *quartz*, *silicon*, are used in various applications, such as in electronics.
